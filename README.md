# Conical One

![Conical adapter rendering](conical_one.png)

A conical adapter for the i3 MK2's filament arms. Use ConicalPlatedForPrinting.stl to 3D print. Compatible with spools (including asymmetric spools) that have a > 38mm inner core diameter.

Add quality 608 bearings for smooth feeding. [Bones Reds](https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Bearings-Reds/dp/B003U7TQ5U) have been tested with this adapter and work reasonably well.

When mounting a spool, the arms might snag slightly on the sides if its spaced too tightly, so give it a slight spin to test and adjust as needed.
