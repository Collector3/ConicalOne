# Conical One Point One

A conical adapter for the i3 MK2's filament arms. This lets MK2 users mount spools with asymmetric sides, or spools with odd inner core diameters/depths.

# Materials needed

3D printer, filament.

Optional: 6x 608 skateboard bearings (3 for each holder). [Bones Reds](https://www.amazon.com/Bones-Bearings-Reds/dp/B003U7TQ5U) have been tested with this adapter and work reasonably well.
The adapter should work without the bearings, but feeding/layer alignment may not be as consistent.

# Printing

Use ConicalOnePointOnePlated.stl to 3D print. The individual objects are available as well.

# Installation

Insert the bearings.

Insert the keyed rod into one of the halves.

Assemble the components with the spool being grabbed fully by both halves (and not by the keyed rod/lopsided).

Attach the MK2 filament arms and press together to ensure the keyed rod is balanced between the two and mount to the frame.

The spool should spin freely (by design there is a gap between bearing face and holder arm).

# Bearing Removal

The flat, long screwdriver(!) blade of a leatherman wave/driver works well. Insert and push up when hitting the inner metal ring, taking care not to push on the bearing race.
